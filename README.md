# HandTrackingModule

The Hand Tracking Module is based on Mediapipe library which is developed by google. The documentation of mediapipe can be found on https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html#python-solution-api

Before using this module please ensure you have python version <=3.7(64-bit), mediapipe, opencv, numpy library installed in your device.

I have added the gesture recognition algorithm into this package so that it could recognize some basic gesture such as one to six and thumbs up, thumbs down. With less than 30 lines of code with this module you will achieved hand tracking and gesture recognition so just enjoy it and have fun.
